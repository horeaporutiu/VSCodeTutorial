# Use IBM Blockchain Platform extension in VSCode to develop a Smart Contract

In tutorial, we will learn the process of using IBM Blockchain Platform's VSCode extension
to  streamline the
process of developing, testing, and deploying a smart contract. The audience for this
tutorial is a developer that has some basic understanding of blockchain, and wants to
understand how to deploy a network to a Hyperledger Fabric instance. Once you finish the
tutorial, you will understand how to quickly develop, demo, and deploy your blockchain
application on a local Hyperledger Fabric network using VSCode.

## Let's get started
![packageFile](/docs/installExtension.gif)
First thing we need to do is to install the IBM Blockchain Platform VSCode extension. You will
need to latest version of VSCode to do this. To see if you have the latest VSCode extension, go to
`Code` -> `Check for Updates`. If VSCode crashes at this point (which it did for me), it likely
means you don't have the latest version. Check the troubleshooting section below if your VSCode
crashed. Otherwise, update your VSCode, and once you're done, click on `extensions` on the
side bar on the left part of your screen. At the top, search the extension marketplace for
`IBM Blockchain Platform`. Click on `Install`. Then click on
`reload`. Nice, you are all set to use the extension! üôåüèº

## Step 1. Create a New Smart Contract Project
![packageFile](/docs/createSmartContract.gif)
To create a smart contract project, click on your newly
downloaded IBM Blockchain Platform extension. It should be the extension all the way at the bottom of the left side bar. Next, use the keyboard shortcut `Shift` + `CMD` + `P` to
bring up all of the commands for the IBM Blockchain Platform. Choose
`Create Smart Contract Project` from the dropdown. Next,
click `JavaScript` from the dropdown. Next, click `New Folder`, and name the project what you want. I named mine
`demoContract`. Click `Create` and then `Open` your new folder which you just created. Next, you'll be prompted with a dropdown, and you can click `Add to Workspace`. Once the extension is done packaging your
contract, you can open the `lib/my-contract.js` file to see your smart
contract code scaffold. Nice job! üëèüèº

## Step 2. Modify Chaincode
![packageFile](/docs/addChaincode.gif)
Inside your `lib/my-contract.js` file, go ahead and copy
and paste this code:

```
'use strict';

const { Contract } = require('fabric-contract-api');

class MyContract extends Contract {

    async instantiate(ctx) {
      const item1 = { field: 'somevalue1', value: 'value1' };
      const item2 = { field: 'somevalue2', value: 'value2' };
      await ctx.stub.putState('ITEM1', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(item1)));
      await ctx.stub.putState('ITEM2', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(item2)));

      let greeting = { text: 'Instantiate was called!' };
      await ctx.stub.putState('GREETING', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(greeting)));
    }

    async transaction1(ctx, arg1) {
        console.info('transaction1', arg1);
        let greeting = { text: arg1 };
        await ctx.stub.putState('GREETING', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(greeting)));
        return JSON.stringify(greeting);
    }

    async getData(ctx, startKey, endKey) {
      console.info(`getData : startKey=${startKey}, endKey=${endKey}`);
      const iterator = await ctx.stub.getStateByRange(startKey, endKey);
      const result = [];
      let res = await iterator.next();
      while (!res.done) {
        if (res.value) {
          console.log(`found state item with key: ${res.value.key}, value: ${res.value.value.toString('utf8')}`);
          const obj = JSON.parse(res.value.value.toString('utf8'));
          result.push(obj);
        }
        res = await iterator.next();
      }
      await iterator.close();
      return result;
  }

}

module.exports = MyContract;
```

It's not much, but it will the
`await ctx.stub.putState('GREETING', Buffer.from
(JSON.stringify(greeting)));` line will update the ledger
with the key-value pair of
```
{
  "GREETING": {
    "text": "hi"
  }
}
```

üößüößüöß Note: the chaincode has been updated to the following,
but the following gifs don't reflect that - don't worry, if you have
the below chaincode, you are all good!

```
async transaction1(ctx, arg1) {
        console.info('transaction1', arg1);
        let greeting = { text: arg1 };
        await ctx.stub.putState('GREETING', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(greeting)));
        return JSON.stringify(greeting);
    }
```

Not much going on here, since this is a hello-world
tutorial, but it shows up the basics of updating the
ledger, which is the most important part of being a
blockchain developer. Also, in `transaction1` you will see that we
are actually returning an object, so we will be able to see if
our smart contract is invoked successfully since we can inspect the
object that is returned from this function. Save the file, and proceed! Good job! üî•

## Step 3. Package Smart Contract
![packageFile](/docs/packageSmartContract.gif)
Now that we have created our smart contract, it's time to package it so we can
connect to a Hyperledger Fabric instance. Let's do our favorite keyboard shortcut
again, `Shift` + `CMD` + `P` and then look for `package smart contract`, and click
on that. The extension will do the rest for you, so sit back, relax, and drink some ‚òïÔ∏è.
In the left sidebar, click on the IBM Blockchain Platform icon. This click will take you
into another dimension - the blockchain dimension. On the top-left corner, you will
have all of your smart contract packages. You should see `demoContract@0.0.1` if
everything went well. Nice job! Time to install, and instantiate this contract! üôåüèº

## Step 4. Install Smart Contract
![packageFile](/docs/installSmartContract.gif)
Ok, we're more than halfway there. Now for the fun part! Let's install this contract on the peer!
To do this, we must first connect to a Hyperledger Fabric network. The network that comes with
the VSCode extension is perfect for development - it offers the minimal set up to develop, and
test your contract. The network consists of a peer, an orderer, a certificate authority, and
a couchdb instance, all running on seperate docker containers. To start our network, look at
your IBM Blockchain Platform extension, at the bottom-right corner where it says `Blockchain Connections`.
You should see something that says `local_fabric`. Go ahead and click that. That should
automatically run a script and you should see the output as follows:
```
Starting fabricvscodelocalfabric_orderer.example.com_1 ... done
Starting fabricvscodelocalfabric_ca.example.com_1      ... done
Starting fabricvscodelocalfabric_couchdb_1             ... done
Starting fabricvscodelocalfabric_peer0.org1.example.com_1 ... done
```
Which shows the docker containers starting up. There is additional output too.
Nice. Now, click the `local_fabric` connection again. Now that it's up and running, it should
take you to your channel view, which should show one channel, named `mychannel`. Click on
`mychannel`, and it will expand the `Peers` and `Instantiated Smart Contracts`. Click on
`peers` and you should see `peer0.org1.example.com`. Right-click on that peer, and click on
`Install Smart Contract`. Next, the extension will ask you which package, and just choose
`demoContract@0.0.1`. That's it! Nice job!

## Step 5. Instantiate Smart Contract
![packageFile](/docs/instantiateSmartContract.gif)
This is the real test - will our smart contract instantiate properly? Let's see.
From the IBM Blockchain extension, in the bottom-left corner, under `Blockchain Connections`,
right-click on `mychannel` and then on `Instantiate / Upgrade Smart Contract`. The extension
will then ask you which contract and version to instantiate, and we will pick `demoContract@0.0.1`.
The extension will then ask you which function to call. You can go ahead and type in `instantiate`.
Next, it will ask you the arguments, for which there are none, so just hit enter. The extension will
do some work, and then you should see in the bottom-right corner that the contract was successfully
instantiated. Hooray!! ü§üüèº

## Step 6. Import certificate and key
![packageFile](/docs/gitPull.gif)
At this point, we need to start interacting a bit more closely with our
Fabric instance. We'll need to import some certs to prove to the certificate
authority that we are allowed to create a digital identity on the network, and
that is by showing the certificate authority our certificate and private key. For the sake of keeping this tutorial as short as possible,
I have made a GitHub repo with all the certs, keys, and scripts we
will work with, so go ahead and git clone this repo in your current
workspace. So go ahead and go outside `demoContract` to clone this
directory - we want to keep our smart contract directory as
lightweight as possible. To do this, just issue the following command:

```
demoContract $ cd ..
```
This will take you outside your `demoContract` directory.

Then go ahead and clone my repository, with the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/horeaporutiu/VSCodeLocalNetwork.git
```
We'll need to import that folder into our workspace. To do that,
right-click on an empty space under your `demoContract` directory
and click `Add Folder to Workspace` and then find the newly cloned folder
which is called `VSCodeLocalNetwork`, and double-click it. That will
bring our new folder into our workspace. Next, check out the
`cert` and `key` files.
These are the certificates that will
be used to prove our identity to the certificate authority. Our main
logic comes from the `addIdentity.js` file. You'll see in that file
which should look like this:

```
'use strict';

// Bring key classes into scope, most importantly Fabric SDK network class
const fs = require('fs');
const { FileSystemWallet, X509WalletMixin } = require('fabric-network');

// A wallet stores a collection of identities for use
const wallet = new FileSystemWallet('./_idwallet');

async function main(){

    // Main try/catch block
    try {

        // define the identity to use
        const cert = fs.readFileSync('./cert').toString();
        const key = fs.readFileSync('./key').toString();
        const identityLabel = 'User1@org1.example.com';

        // prep wallet and test it at the same time
        await wallet.import(identityLabel, X509WalletMixin.createIdentity('Org1MSP', cert, key));

    } catch (error) {
        console.log(`Error adding to wallet. ${error}`);
        console.log(error.stack);
    }
}

main().then(()=>{
    console.log('done');
}).catch((e)=>{
    console.log(e);
    console.log(e.stack);
    process.exit(-1);
});
```
In terms of the code above,
we are importing the new `fabric-network` module from NPM, and then
using that to create an identity by passing in our cert and private
key that we got from the GitHub repo. The new identity will be stored
in a folder called `_idwallet`. The most important line of this file
is the `await wallet.import(identityLabel, X509WalletMixin.createIdentity('Org1MSP', cert, key));` line which actually creates a new MSP identity using our
cert and key file. This [MSP(Membership Service Provider)](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/msp.html)
 identity will be able to connect to the
network and invoke smart contracts.

## Step 7. Add Identity
![packageFile](/docs/addIdentityScript.gif)
Next, we need to run `npm install` to install all the dependencies that
are needed to connect to our local Fabric network.
Run `npm install` in the `VSCodeLocalNetwork`. Then, run `node addIdentity`.
You should see that this command creates a new folder called `_idwallet` and
populates that folder with the MSP identity, which in our case goes by the name
of
`User1@org1.example.com`. Nice job!


## Step 8. Update network ports
![packageFile](/docs/addPorts.gif)
Next, open the `network.yaml` in the `VSCodeLocalNetwork` folder. We will use this file to connect
to our Docker containers running locally. To see your docker containers
running locally, run `docker ps`.

Your output should look something like this:

![packageFile](/docs/ports.png)

 üößüößüöß Everyone's ports will be different, so you  cannot just copy my port numbers
here, it wont work! üößüößüöß Next, look for `fabric-peer`,`fabric-ca`,
and `fabric-orderer` in the `docker ps` logs. It's gonna be jumbled up, probably, so
be careful here. The 5 digit number is the port number that we need to update in the
appropriate place in the `network.yaml` file. So for the peer, ca, and orderer, we
must update the `url` field as shown above in the gif.

So for the example above, I would change the ports in `network.yaml` to the
following. First the orderer:

```
orderers:
  orderer.example.com:
    url: grpc://localhost:32823
```
Then the peer:

```
peers:
  peer0.org1.example.com:
    # this URL is used to send endorsement and query requests
    url: grpc://localhost:32827

```

Then the CA:

```
certificateAuthorities:
  ca-org1:
    url: http://localhost:32822
```
Nice. Save the file.

## Step 9. Invoke Smart Contract
![packageFile](/docs/invoke.gif)
Ok, so we've instantiated our contract, created our identity, so now what?
Well now, let's actually invoke it! To do this, we will need a script.
That's where our `invoke.js` comes in. Let's take a look at this file.
After importing the `fabric-network` module, we use the identity stored
in the `_idwallet` to connect to our fabric network. This happens on
this line
```
await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, connectionOptions);
```

Notice here that our connection profile is the `network.yaml` file that
we updated in the previous step, and the `connectionOptions` is an object
which contains the credentials from our `./_idwallet` directory. After we
connect to the network, we need to specify the channel to connect to, which
in our case happens to be `mychannel`. This line connects to our channel:

```
const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');
```
Our channel may
have many contracts installed, so in the next line, we specify which contract
to invoke. Which in our case, is `demoContract`.

```
const contract = await network.getContract('demoContract');
```
 The final part
of our script picks which function to invoke, and specifies the arguments. In
our case we are invoking `transaction1` with an arg of `hello` as can be seen
here:

```
let response = await contract.submitTransaction('transaction1', 'hello');
```

Now, we can run the script, by using this command:
```
$ node invoke.js
```
If all goes well, you should see the following output:

```
VSCodeLocalNetwork$ node invoke.js
Connected to Fabric gateway.
Connected to mychannel.

Submit hello world transaction.
info: [TransactionEventHandler]: _strategySuccess: strategy success for transaction "9bf00460721a9d42dfe0d3bf93151f10be8b0a57011d4b24262ef03d5a33ee5e"

{ text: 'hello' }
Disconnect from Fabric gateway.
done
```
Woo!! That's it! You made it! üí™üèºüí™üèº


## Step 10. Conclusion
Nice job! You are done! You learned how to create, package, install, instantiate,
and invoke a smart contract using Hyperledger's newest API's. At this point,
you can focus on developing your smart contract, and update your `my-contract.js`
file knowing that you have taken care of the networking aspects of blockchain,
and that you can successfully invoke, and update your ledger using just VSCode,
Node.js, and Docker. Please, please, please reach out to me if there are bugs,
comment on this post, and tell me, and I will fix them. Thanks so much for
reading this post, and hope you enjoyed it! Horea Blockchain out!

















<!-- If you check your downloaded files now, you should have a file starting with `cred` ending in `.json`. Let's rename this file to `creds.json` and move this file to the root of our carauction-network directory.

Open `enrolladmin.js` and the newly downloaded `creds.json` in an editor of your choice. I prefer VSCode. -->

<!--

at this point, you can go into your terminal and run `$ docker ps` to see the containers. You should
have 4 at this point, namely, the peer, orderer, CA, and couchdb. Nice job :) -->

<!-- First, let's create a seperate folder for our identity work,
since we want to keep our contract directory as lightweight as possible.
Create a new folder called `fabricNetwork`. Go into your newly created directory
and with the following command:
```
$ cd fabricNetwork
```
Then clone my files into that fabricNetwork directory:
```
$ cd fabricNetwork
```

Now, we'll create a few files that will hold certificates that will
be used to grant us a digital identity. First create a new file
called `cert` and paste in the following code in there:
```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIICGTCCAb+gAwIBAgIQPyhm+v0ZIqCo6MATzLc+5jAKBggqhkjOPQQDAjBzMQsw
CQYDVQQGEwJVUzETMBEGA1UECBMKQ2FsaWZvcm5pYTEWMBQGA1UEBxMNU2FuIEZy

ZKPD7ikt+vOYgVnqlA==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

```

Save the file! Similarly, create another file called `key`, and paste in the following private key:
```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGHAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQgJ8IrEgxfZzjGsyt+
0o27jvhwUJE2W1PrFeZi8LwHbiuhRANCAAQv9KiY1U7dHmeex6ZDiKb9RRnwjGzv
+cfc0fVE59Un6bueIN/VmaG9PKInOtSkj6fn784ohf9n9WEO4AhH9Ass
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

```
And save the file!
Next, create a file called `addIdentity.js` and paste in the following
code:

```
'use strict';

// Bring key classes into scope, most importantly Fabric SDK network class
const fs = require('fs');
const { FileSystemWallet, X509WalletMixin } = require('fabric-network');

// A wallet stores a collection of identities for use
const wallet = new FileSystemWallet('./_idwallet');

async function main(){

    // Main try/catch block
    try {

        // define the identity to use
        const cert = fs.readFileSync('./cert').toString();
        const key = fs.readFileSync('./key').toString();
        const identityLabel = 'User1@org1.example.com';

        // prep wallet and test it at the same time
        await wallet.import(identityLabel, X509WalletMixin.createIdentity('Org1MSP', cert, key));

    } catch (error) {
        console.log(`Error adding to wallet. ${error}`);
        console.log(error.stack);
    }
}

main().then(()=>{
    console.log('done');
}).catch((e)=>{
    console.log(e);
    console.log(e.stack);
    process.exit(-1);
});
```
Save the file. Great. We're doing amazing so far. Only a few more things and you'll
be ready to invoke that smart contract! In terms of the code above,
we are importing the new `fabric-network` module from NPM, and then
using that to create an identity by passing in our cert and private
key that we created in the previous steps. The new identity will be stored
in a folder called `_idwallet`.

## 6. Create Identity
![packageFile](/docs/addIdentity.gif)
Now that we have our certs set up, we are ready to create our digital
identity. Let's create a new file called `addIdentity.js` and paste in the
following code:

```
'use strict';

// Bring key classes into scope, most importantly Fabric SDK network class
const fs = require('fs');
const { FileSystemWallet, X509WalletMixin } = require('fabric-network');

// A wallet stores a collection of identities for use
const wallet = new FileSystemWallet('./_idwallet');

async function main(){

    // Main try/catch block
    try {

        // define the identity to use
        const cert = fs.readFileSync('./cert').toString();
        const key = fs.readFileSync('./key').toString();
        const identityLabel = 'User1@org1.example.com';

        // prep wallet and test it at the same time
        await wallet.import(identityLabel, X509WalletMixin.createIdentity('Org1MSP', cert, key));

    } catch (error) {
        console.log(`Error adding to wallet. ${error}`);
        console.log(error.stack);
    }
}

main().then(()=>{
    console.log('done');
}).catch((e)=>{
    console.log(e);
    console.log(e.stack);
    process.exit(-1);
});
```
and then save that file. Next, run `npm init`, and just hit enter so you
get all the defaults. Next, we need to install the dependency that our script
uses, and we will use npm for that. Run the following to save the dependency in
your `package.json`:

`npm install fabric-network --save`

You may have some vulnerabilities in your packages, like me. If so,
run `npm audit fix`.

Now, run the script:

`node addIdentity.js`. This should have created a folder called `_idwallet`
and saved certs and keys in there. Nice, we are sooo close! -->
